Research paper
==============

The thesis is split up into separate directories and files corresponding to the different parts and sections of the paper. This allows to organise the structure of the document in the main file while decluttering the text sections. The main folders are

	* :file:`conclusion` contains the conclusion.
	* :file:`introduction` contains the introduction.
	* :file:`misc` contains the the title page and statement of authorship.
	* :file:`part_1` contains the section on the theory behind the bandwidth selection procedures.
	* :file:`part_2` contains the section on the simulation study.
	* :file:`part_3` contains the section on the estimation of the world income distribution.

The three main folders each contain a folder for the subsections as well as figures where applicable. Each section is created from the subsections. The sections are bound together by a file containing the outline of the section.
